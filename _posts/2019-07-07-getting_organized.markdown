To be honest I didn't think it would take this long to find my first job as a Junior Developer but alas, here I am.  It seems as if this is completely normal and that it can take up to six months to land the first job...phew, what a long time!  The good news is that there is no shortage of things to practice and learn which quite frankly is one of the main reasons I got into development in the first place.  

These past few weeks after graduation I have applied to quite a few jobs as I did the prevoius weeks and have been getting very few responses.  I did have a phone interview which gave me some insight and the practice that I had been hoping for.  It did go fairly well and I hope to have a follow up interview which will be my first technical interview.  To prepare for it I have been going over the questions found searching "React technical interview questions"  and my new favorite resource [FullStack Cafe](https://www.fullstack.cafe) where there are interview questions covering 50 different topics.

Figuring out a plan of attack for the best way for me to get and stay organized, keep my spirits up, my stress down and pay attention to the life still going on around me is still a work in progress but improved from the first week.  Instead of getting sucked into a day of [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) I find I feel more productive when I browse LinkedIn, reading up on companies I am interested in, learning about their values, getting a feel for what type of culture I might best fit into.  Browsing LinkedIn supports my networking outreach as well where I am finding contacts, mentors and like minded people to connect with.  Touching up and beginning to expand my projects while I brainstorm another idea that I would like to build out was a fun endeavor this week.

I began to build out my portfolio site as well this week as having  a strong web presence is appearing ever more important.  This is especially true for someone like myself who has a very quiet web presence using solely LinkedIn and Instagram the most often.  Creating a Portfolio site at this point in my career is a must it seems and will be a fun change of pace.

**Goal Points to hit each day:
Morning:
* Codewars practice
* LinkedIn outreach
* GitHub commits
Afternoon:
* Exercise
* Self care (getting outside)
Evening:

* Interview question review
* Learn something new
