The day I had been waiting for is finally here.  I have graduated from Flatiron School and have begun my job search.  So much has changed in the past year since I started this program as life always seems to and what I thought I wanted then is different from what I find myself wanting now.  Moving out of my hometown or surrounding cities never once sounded appealing.  Now that I have graduated, the saying, "The world is your oyster" comes to mind and the opportunity to live and work somewhere I have never been sounds exciting.  This mentality will undoubtably open doors for me that would otherwise be closed.  Being open and willing to relocate expands my job search radius ten fold which is quite helpful as it seems the Junior positions in my area are a tad scarce.

Being a new graduate with several hundred hours, lessons, “blood, sweat and tears” (that seems to come with learning how to code) and the resulting several projects under my belt have all brought me here, now and built my confidence as a Junior developer. 

It is no secret that interviews can be daunting, especially in the beginning as a new graduate. What I am focusing on now is interview preparation by completing coding challenge problems reaching out to those in my network on LinkedIn, fine tuning my resume, building my portfolio and beginning another coding project.!

Patience is essential during this time, as although it has only been a week of active job searching and submitting applications, it does seem as though it has been longer.  This next week I will do what I’ve read other job seekers do which is take more time for me and other aspects of my life such as getting outdoors, signing up for gym classes and begin trying other new things that I have had on hold for the past year while I finished this program.  Taking ample care of myself by finding balance between the job search, building my portfolio, continuing to develop my skills and also living life day too day will be the secret to success and minimal stress.  After all, this is to be exciting and fun!
